This work is dedicated to my parents.  

## Acknowledgments  
I sincerely thank MD. AYUB ALI, Assistant Professor, Barishal University, for his great advice, helpful criticism, and unwavering support, which were essential in shaping this project. Additionally, I am appreciative of the Barishal University students who voluntarily took part in this study and offered insightful commentary on the Objective-Based Education (OBE) curriculum. Their opinions and thoughts were crucial to the accomplishment of this study.  

## Abstract  
This study explores the opinions of Barishal University first-year students in the 2021–22 academic year about the recently introduced Objective-Based Education (OBE) curriculum. The study seeks to determine students' perceptions regarding the advantages, challenges, and effectiveness of the OBE method, which has not yet been completely adopted by all departments. Results highlight how students feel about the OBE curriculum’s main features, such as its alignment with learning objectives, applicability to career paths, and implementation challenges. These insights provide useful information for policymakers and curriculum designers.

## Chapter One: Introduction  
### 1.1 Background  
In Bangladesh, higher education institutions have increased significantly, making quality education crucial. The **Objective-Based Education (OBE)** system aims to improve learning outcomes by focusing on measurable objectives. Barishal University introduced the OBE curriculum to align with international education standards. However, its adoption has faced challenges such as resource constraints and traditional teaching methods.  

### 1.2 Context  
The **OBE framework** shifts the focus from content delivery to skill acquisition and competency development. It emphasizes well-defined learning objectives, student-centered learning, and continuous assessment to enhance students’ real-world preparedness.  

### 1.3 Purpose  
This study aims to:  
- Evaluate students’ understanding of the OBE system.  
- Assess its effectiveness in achieving academic and career goals.  
- Identify challenges faced by students.  
- Gather recommendations for improving the curriculum.

## Chapter Two: Literature Review  
Previous research highlights that OBE improves educational outcomes through structured learning objectives and student-centered approaches (Spady, 1988; Gieseen-Hood, 1999). However, its implementation requires adequate resources, faculty training, and assessment modifications. Studies in other countries, including **South Africa, Australia, and the USA**, provide insights into its impact. In Bangladesh, the National Education Policy (2010) emphasizes the need for OBE adoption, but practical implementation challenges remain.

## Chapter Three: Methodology  
### Research Design  
- **Study Type**: Cross-sectional quantitative study  
- **Participants**: 100 students from Barishal University  
- **Data Collection**: Structured questionnaire  
- **Statistical Tools**: SPSS, R  

### Key Variables  
- **Independent Variables**: Knowledge of OBE, student satisfaction, challenges faced  
- **Dependent Variable**: Recommendation of OBE system  

### Analysis Techniques  
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, frequency distributions  
- **Chi-Square Tests**: Assess relationships between categorical variables  
- **Logistic Regression**: Identify predictors of student satisfaction  

---

## Chapter Four: Results & Analysis  
### 4.1 Frequency Distribution  
- **63%** of students find OBE relevant to their careers.  
- **50%** reported difficulty adapting to new learning methods.  
- **82%** changed their study habits under the OBE system.  
- **93%** believe OBE prepares them for real-world applications.  

### 4.2 Chi-Square Tests  
- Significant association between student satisfaction and availability of learning resources.  
- No significant correlation between recommendation for OBE and instructor communication.  

### 4.3 Logistic Regression  
- **Key Findings**: Students’ perceptions of flexibility and clarity in learning objectives significantly impact their satisfaction.  
- **Odds Ratio Analysis**: A higher satisfaction level increases the likelihood of recommending the OBE system.

## Chapter Five: Discussion & Conclusion  
### 5.1 Key Findings  
- **Strengths**: Clear learning objectives, real-world relevance, student-centered approach.  
- **Challenges**: Resource limitations, assessment transparency, faculty adaptation.  

### 5.2 Recommendations  
- Enhance resource availability (books, online materials).  
- Improve faculty training on OBE principles.  
- Refine assessment methods for better learning outcome measurement.  

### 5.3 Limitations  
- Small sample size (100 students).  
- Limited to one university; results may not generalize to all institutions.
